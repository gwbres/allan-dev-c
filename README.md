# Allan Deviation C Tools 

This is a light collection of C functions,
to compute Allan & derived statistics.

These statistics are used in several fields:

+ Measure & study the stability 
of a signal or a reference signal
(beat signal, clock signal, reference signal..)

+ Statistics of sensors data, or fractions
of errors compared to a reference

+ Determine the power law fitting
a distribution (Gyroscope, accelerometer calibrations,
noise distributions against time, ...)

+ Compare references to each other
(so called "3 cornered hat").

## Learn from this project

+ How to compute ADEV, MDEV, ODEV.. all variations
of the Allan deviation
+ ADEV, MDEV plot analysis
